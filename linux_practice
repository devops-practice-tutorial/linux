Let us create a new user named vivek using the useradd command on Ubuntu:
==========================================================================

In ubuntu linux server while creating user with any name the user home directory not coming by default

For that:
=========

 sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/hareesh/ -m -G sudo hareesh
 
 
-s /bin/bash – Set /bin/bash as login shell of the new account
-d /home/vivek/ – Set /home/vivek/ as home directory of the new Ubuntu account
-m – Create the user’s home directory
-G sudo – Make sure vivek user can sudo i.e. give admin access to the new account


generate ssh keys in your gitbash

ssh-keygen

it can create id_rsa id_rsa.pub known_hosts files

In linux server in your home directory you can do following steps
================================================================

create .ssh directory

change the permessions 

chmod 700 .ssh

create one file in .ssh directory with authorized_keys

vi .ssh/authorized_keys

paste id_rsa.pub file content here

change permessions for that file

chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

restart your server

sudo service /etc/init.d/ssh restart

now you can login with your name into linux server

ssh -i "pem.pem" hareesh@ec2-18-119-98-105.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com


sudo deluser --remove-home hareesh

ps aux | grep 1948

killall -TERM -u hareesh

userdel hareesh
